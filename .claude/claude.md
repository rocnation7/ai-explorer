Title: AI in Practice for Wealth & Asset Management
Author: Anthony Nicastro
Status: Draft v1.1 (Full)
Document Type: Client-facing Marketing & Thought Leadership Platform

============================================================

1. EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
   ============================================================

AI is rapidly reshaping how work gets done across every industry, but in wealth and asset management, adoption is uneven, cautious, and often unclear. Advisors and RIAs understand that AI matters, yet lack practical, finance-native examples of how to use it responsibly in their daily workflows.

This product is a client-facing website designed to inspire, educate, and engage Lazard’s wealth clients, RIAs, and distribution partners by showing them how AI can be applied—today and tomorrow—to reinvent their work. The platform is intentionally AI-tool agnostic, focused on patterns and workflows rather than vendors, and positioned as a relationship-deepening marketing asset rather than a training or sales site.

The end state is a premium, captivating experience that:

* Builds trust and credibility
* Sparks modern AI conversations
* Generates qualified engagement signals
* Positions Lazard as a long-term strategic partner

============================================================
2. PROBLEM STATEMENT
====================

Target users face four core challenges:

1. AI uncertainty

   * Unclear what is allowed vs. risky
   * Fear of compliance or data misuse

2. Lack of relevant inspiration

   * Most AI education is generic or tech-first
   * Very little is tailored to wealth advisory workflows

3. Time and scale pressure

   * Advisors are expected to personalize more, faster
   * Content, communication, and analysis demands are growing

4. Vendor noise

   * Tool-centric marketing creates skepticism
   * Advisors want guidance, not sales pitches

Current AI education platforms fail to meet these needs because they are horizontal, instructional, or vendor-specific.

============================================================
3. PRODUCT VISION
=================

“How wealth professionals can responsibly and creatively reimagine their work using AI—today and in the future.”

* A technical tutorial

This is:

* A thought leadership destination
* A conversation catalyst
* A quiet but powerful brand differentiator
